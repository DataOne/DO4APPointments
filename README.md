If you click on "Details" you get an overview to this specific event.

Just click on "New Event".

A dialog appears in which you can input all necessary data for your new event.

Please specify several possible date/times, so that users can choose which would be best for them.

## Voting for an event
You can share your events with others. Click on "Create Link to Vote". Then you have 3 possibilities to share your link:

- **Open dialog** with the link inside
- **Copy to clipboard** - this does not work in every browser
- **Write a mail** with link already filled in the body

When users click on your link the Add-In opens with the specified event shown in a dialog. Now your friend is able to vote for one or more appointment proposals which are proper for him/her.

The appointment with the most votes is highlighted:
